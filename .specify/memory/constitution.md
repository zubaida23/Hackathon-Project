# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Constitution

## Core Principles

### Accuracy Through Primary Source Verification
All factual and technical claims must be traceable to verified sources; Citations required for all research papers, official documentation, and industry whitepapers; No unverified claims accepted in content.

### Clarity for Beginners and Intermediate Learners
Content must be structured progressively from basic to advanced concepts; Explanations should be simple and accessible; Technical jargon must be defined when introduced.

### Reproducibility and Traceability
All technical claims must be citable and verifiable; Code examples must be runnable and documented; System architectures must reflect real implementations.

### Practical Rigor in Real-World Systems
Focus on actual robotics and AI workflows; Code examples must represent production-ready patterns; Documentation must address real-world deployment scenarios.

### Zero-Tolerance Plagiarism Policy
All content must be original with proper attribution; Direct copying from sources prohibited; Citation format must follow academic standards.

### GitHub Pages Deployment Standard
All content must build and deploy successfully on GitHub Pages; Docusaurus documentation format required; Code examples must be tested in deployment pipeline.

## Key Standards

### Source Verification Requirements
- All factual claims must cite peer-reviewed research papers, official robotics/AI documentation, or industry whitepapers
- Citation format: Markdown-compatible academic citations
- Primary sources preferred over secondary interpretations

### Content Quality Standards
- Writing clarity: Simple, structured, and progressive explanations
- Technical accuracy: Verified against authoritative sources
- Educational progression: Beginner to intermediate level accessibility

### Code and Implementation Standards
- Code examples must be runnable and properly documented
- System diagrams must reflect real working systems
- All technical implementations must be reproducible

## Constraints

### Format and Platform Requirements
- Format: Docusaurus documentation framework
- Deployment target: GitHub Pages
- File structure must comply with Docusaurus standards

### Content Limitations
- Technical claims limited to verified sources
- Code examples must run in documented environments
- Diagrams must represent actual system architectures

## Success Criteria

### Verification Requirements
- All claims verified against authoritative sources
- Zero plagiarism detected through automated checks
- Content builds and deploys successfully on GitHub Pages

### Educational Impact
- Content accessible to beginners and intermediate learners
- Progressive complexity with clear explanations
- Practical applicability to real-world robotics systems

## Governance

This constitution governs all development activities for the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics project. All contributions must comply with these principles. Amendments require documentation of changes and approval by project maintainers. All PRs and reviews must verify compliance with these standards. Code examples and technical claims must be validated against authoritative sources before acceptance.
