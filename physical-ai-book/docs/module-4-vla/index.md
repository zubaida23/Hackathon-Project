# Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)

## Overview

Welcome to Module 4 of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics course. This module focuses on integrating vision, language, and action into a unified autonomy loop. You'll learn how to create systems that can understand natural language commands, perceive the environment, and execute appropriate robotic actions.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Implement voice-to-action processing using Whisper for speech recognition
- Create LLM-based cognitive planning systems for robotic tasks
- Integrate natural language processing with ROS 2 action execution
- Build a complete capstone system: an autonomous humanoid robot with VLA capabilities

## Module Structure

This module is divided into several key sections:

1. **Voice Processing**: Speech recognition and command interpretation
2. **LLM Planning**: Cognitive planning with large language models
3. **Action Execution**: Translating plans to robotic actions
4. **Capstone Project**: Complete VLA system integration

## Prerequisites

- Completion of Modules 1-3
- Understanding of natural language processing concepts
- Familiarity with ROS 2 action servers and clients

## What's Next

This is the final module of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics course. After completing this module, you'll have built a complete system that integrates all components learned throughout the course.
