# Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac)

## Overview

Welcome to Module 3 of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics course. This module focuses on enabling perception, navigation, and learning capabilities for humanoid robots using NVIDIA Isaac ecosystem. You'll learn about Isaac Sim for synthetic data generation, Isaac ROS for accelerated perception pipelines, and Nav2-based navigation systems.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Use NVIDIA Isaac Sim for synthetic data generation and perception pipeline development
- Implement Isaac ROS accelerated perception pipelines
- Create Visual SLAM and navigation systems
- Develop Nav2-based path planning for humanoid robots
- Understand sim-to-real transfer workflows

## Module Structure

This module is divided into several key sections:

1. **Isaac Platform Overview**: Introduction to NVIDIA Isaac ecosystem
2. **Perception Pipelines**: Accelerated computer vision for robotics
3. **SLAM and Navigation**: Mapping and autonomous navigation
4. **Sim-to-Real Transfer**: Bridging simulation and reality

## Prerequisites

- Completion of Modules 1 and 2
- Understanding of basic computer vision concepts
- Familiarity with ROS 2 and simulation environments

## What's Next

After completing this module, you'll move on to Module 4 where you'll integrate vision, language, and action into a unified autonomy system.
