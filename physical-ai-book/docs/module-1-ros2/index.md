# Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

## Overview

Welcome to Module 1 of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics course. This module introduces you to the foundational middleware layer that connects AI agents to humanoid robot hardware using ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2).

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Understand ROS 2 core concepts: nodes, topics, services, and actions
- Create Python-based robot controllers using rclpy
- Implement AI-to-controller communication patterns
- Model humanoid robots with URDF (Unified Robot Description Format)

## Module Structure

This module is divided into several key sections:

1. **ROS 2 Concepts**: Core communication patterns and architecture
2. **Python Control**: Using rclpy for robot programming
3. **AI-to-Controller Communication**: Bridging high-level AI and low-level control
4. **URDF Modeling**: Creating accurate robot representations

## Prerequisites

- Basic Python programming knowledge
- Understanding of fundamental robotics concepts
- Familiarity with Linux command line

## What's Next

After completing this foundational module, you'll move on to Module 2 where you'll build a digital twin of your robot in simulation environments.
