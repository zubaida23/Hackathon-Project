# Introduction to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

## Welcome to the Course

Welcome to the comprehensive guide on **Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics**! This course provides an in-depth exploration of building intelligent humanoid robots that can perceive, reason, and act in the physical world.

## Course Overview

This course is structured around four interconnected modules that form a complete system for humanoid robotics:

### Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)
- **Foundation**: Learn ROS 2 core concepts including nodes, topics, services, and actions
- **Control**: Implement Python-based robot control using rclpy
- **Modeling**: Create humanoid robot models with URDF (Unified Robot Description Format)

### Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)
- **Simulation**: Build physics-accurate virtual replicas of humanoid robots
- **Sensors**: Implement realistic sensor simulation (LiDAR, cameras, IMUs)
- **Testing**: Create Gazebo-based environments for safe algorithm validation

### Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac)
- **Perception**: Develop accelerated perception pipelines using Isaac ROS
- **Navigation**: Implement Visual SLAM and Nav2-based path planning
- **Transfer**: Learn sim-to-real workflows for real-world deployment

### Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)
- **Interaction**: Integrate voice-to-action processing using Whisper
- **Planning**: Implement LLM-based cognitive planning for complex tasks
- **Integration**: Build a complete autonomous humanoid robot system

## What You'll Learn

By completing this course, you will gain expertise in:

- **Robotics Middleware**: Master ROS 2 for robot communication and control
- **Simulation**: Create realistic digital twins for safe testing and validation
- **AI Integration**: Implement perception, navigation, and learning systems
- **Natural Interaction**: Build voice-activated and conversational AI systems
- **System Integration**: Combine all components into a unified humanoid robot

## Target Audience

This course is designed for:
- Robotics engineers and researchers
- AI and machine learning practitioners
- Computer science students and professionals
