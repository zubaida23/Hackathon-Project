# Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)

## Overview

Welcome to Module 2 of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics course. This module focuses on creating a physics-accurate virtual replica of the humanoid robot using simulation environments. You'll learn to build digital twins that enable safe testing and validation of robotic algorithms before deployment on real hardware.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Create physics-accurate simulation environments with Gazebo
- Implement realistic sensor simulation (LiDAR, cameras, IMUs)
- Build Gazebo-based testing environments for robot validation
- Understand Unity integration for high-fidelity visualization

## Module Structure

This module is divided into several key sections:

1. **Digital Twin Concepts**: Understanding the purpose and benefits
2. **Gazebo Setup**: Creating simulation environments
3. **Sensor Simulation**: Implementing realistic sensors
4. **Unity Visualization**: High-fidelity rendering (overview)

## Prerequisites

- Completion of Module 1 (ROS 2 concepts)
- Understanding of basic physics simulation
- Familiarity with 3D modeling concepts

## What's Next

After completing this module, you'll move on to Module 3 where you'll implement AI-powered perception and navigation systems for your digital twin robot.
